## Contributing Guidelines

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)

***Pull Requests*** are the ***best*** way to ***propose changes*** to the codebase. We actively **welcome** your **pull requests.**

#### 1. Fork the repo, clone your fork, and create your branch from `master` with your initials in the branch name e.g.

```bash
$ git checkout -b sds/bug_fix
```

#### 2. Push your branch and submit a pull request to us as soon as possible, even if it's still work in progress.

#### 3. If you've added a new feature or dependency, make sure you update the documentation.

#### 4. Make sure you use a linter for your code, we recommend pylint.

#### 5. Finaly co-operate with maintainers to get your contribution merged!

## Report Bugs using Github [Issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/sportsdatasolutions/python_json_csv/issues/new); it's that easy! 

**Write Bug Reports** with ***detail, background, and sample code.***

We recommend having a quick read of stack overflow's [how to ask a question guideline](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask.) Also have a look at [this as a good example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a bug report (Expected Behaviour vs Actual Behaviour).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).
